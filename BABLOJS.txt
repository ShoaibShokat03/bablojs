My name is Muhammad Shoaib and I am a full stack web application developer with 4 years of experiense with working a lot of projects and learning. I developed the BABLOJS for the fun when i started just in 2023. I started learingin react but i feel it hard its making me some accourd feel. react is good and very good but i started to work on this project. i change its name during this period but i chose BABLOJS because i call my son BABLO so i chose BABLOJS its a diffrent and unique to provide a feel so. this framewworks take 2 years to code its not so hard to code but i can give proper time so i use my some of time to give it. I started to improve my code with diffrent ai tools chatgpt helps because i have know so much good in js but i love js. React uses node but i make it complete node modules fre full feel like reactive but with out node. I learn react i find some issues in react i improve my framework. for more simplicty.
